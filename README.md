# AntyAliasing Sample Project

This is a sample project demonstrating two methods of antialiasing using OpenTK Libary:
* Multisampling
* Antialising using accumulation buffer

## Instructions

Following project supports two control modes:
- Keyboard + Mouse
- Mouse with Menu drawn

### Keyboard + Mouse

Keys:
WSAD - Movement
Mouse - Moves camera 
Keys 1-4 change which antialiasing method is used
Key 1 - No Antialising
Key 2 - Accumulation Buffer 5x5
Key 3 - Accumulation Buffer 7x7
Key 4 - Multisampling
Key 5 - Changes control mode

### Mouse with Menu

Render simple menu (5 diffrent colored squares) and locks camera at the start position.
From left buttons are :
- No Antialising
- Accumulation Buffer 5x5
- Accumulation Buffer 7x7
- Multisampling
- Changes control mode
